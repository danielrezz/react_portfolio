    <p>My name is Daniel and Iâ€™m a musician and audio engineer living in Austin, TX. 
        Music had always been a part of my life growing up - from forming garage rock bands to playing on the high school drum line - and it continues to be. 
        This led me to pursue audio engineering at the Art Institute of Austin in which I found a knack for post-production. 
        Over the years, I have gathered experience and skills that have allowed me to work on numerous independent films, music projects, and podcasts. 
        I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin to learn how to code. My main goal is to bring coding into my audio work and create something exciting!</p>
